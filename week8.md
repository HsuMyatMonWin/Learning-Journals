# Week 8 Learning Experiment

## Hypothesis:
Studying right after a class will help me learn quicker and memorize better since I will remember what is covered in 
the seminars.

## Reason for this test:
I've been struggling with time lately in balancing time to study, time to do assignments, and time to do my other 
responsibilities. I wanted to find a more efficient studying method. I normally take a long rest or sometimes put 
off studying until the next day since I don't like to push myself to study when I'm tired. I used to believe that 
it's best to study when I have the most mental energy. However, that proves to be quite problematic when I'm short 
on time.

## Limitations:
To make a fair test, I will have to experiment on two days, one day studying right after class and the other day 
studying after a couple of hours of a break. However, I have to finish the test in one week and I only have one 
class per subject per week. Therefore, I was not able to test on the same subject. Instead, I had one test on Data 
Mining and the other on Advanced Data Communication. Although the content of these subjects is quite different, the 
class duration, schedule situation, and format are quite similar, therefore, I believe it will produce somewhat 
reliable results. Another caveat is that I will be studying one subject later than the other, so it is possible that 
I will remember one subject better that the other due to recency when doing the final reflection.

## Test:
**Method:** Study for approximately two hours after Data Mining class recounting on the material covered in class and 
the exercises in practical. Two days later, take a break for about 5 or 6 hours after Advanced Data Mining Class, 
and then study for approximately 2 hours recounting on the material covered in class and the exercises in practical.

**Data points:** After each study session, I will take notes on self-assessment of how well the study session went, 
what difficulties I noticed, how much content I covered in that session, and how I feel about the studying in that 
session. After one day, I will note the self-assessment of how much content I remember from each study session.

**Analysis:** At the end of the test, I will compare my notes as well as do some self-reflection to determine which 
method is better.

## Results:

**Studying right after class:** I was able to remember more from the class, so I can go through the content much 
quicker. I also remember the point where I get confused in class, so I can spend more time on those specific 
parts. I got tired towards then end of the study session since I got to study right away after class. I felt 
slightly numb upset in this session, since I forced myself to study even though I wanted to rest.

**Studying after taking a break:** I remember less about the things I got confused in class, so I wasn't able to 
address those directly. I still remember things fairly well on what is covered in class, but in less detailed 
and a more refined way. I still was able to cover less content since I had to spend more time to familiarize 
myself with the content. I felt more relaxed and was able to maintain my energy levels till the end of the study 
session since I rested well before studying.

## Insights:
Studying right after class seems to be more efficient and more thorough. I can target the things I didn't get well 
in class better. However, it is unlikely that I will be able to manage longer study sessions that way. Since I am 
tired, I was not able to focus very well, although it felt like it required slightly less concentration to learn 
(probably due to recency). Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages. If I'm having a busy week or if I 
am having difficulties with a large portion of the content, I'm definitely going to apply this method and study 
right after class to save some time. If not, I will take some notes right after class on what parts I'm confused 
about, so that I can address that later when I study. Then I can do the studying after a break. The note-taking 
should only take a couple of minutes to half an hour, so I won't get tired with that. This way I will be less likely 
to get burned out and get to do things at my own pace.
