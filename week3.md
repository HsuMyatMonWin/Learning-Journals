## Content Insights
Through the recommended LinkedIn Learning course, I learned about setting up WordPress websites on a live hosting 
service as well as a local development environment. Themes, both free and premium, offered a playground for creativity.
I experimented with layouts, colors, and fonts, realizing the impact a well-chosen theme can have on a website's 
aesthetics.Additionally, the course covers staging servers, which are a great way to ensure that your website 
is working well before publishing. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Discovering the significance of staging servers has proven invaluable for my career. Previously, when I faced a 
theme-plugin compatibility issue, I encountered a roadblock. The inability to alter the theme without affecting 
the live website hindered my troubleshooting efforts. Had I been aware of staging servers, I would have been able to
test and adjust the website before going live.
In terms of employability, I've learned that tangible results often outweigh intentions. The ability to deliver 
completed work is highly sought after in team building. Furthermore, I've come to understand the diversity in working 
styles, with some preferring face-to-face collaboration, while others opt for individual or online work. Adaptability 
to these preferences is a valuable skill. People have different strengths and weaknesses, enabling them to assume 
various roles within a team environment.
