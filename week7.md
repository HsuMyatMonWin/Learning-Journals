I didn't manage to make time for LinkedIn course so no content insight for this week.  

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Looking back on this week, I've been thinking a lot about how to manage my time better, especially with a 
bunch of assignments piling up. Despite my attempts to plan things out, I got sick for a few days and couldn't 
finish my tasks on time. Because of that, I didn't make any time to go over the learning materials. Looking back,
I realize I should have expected the unexpected and adjusted my plans accordingly. This whole experience reminds 
me how important it is to be flexible and stick to a schedule, even when things don't go as planned.
