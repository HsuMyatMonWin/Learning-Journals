The course covers the core functionalities of Sass, including the utilization of variables to maintain consistency 
across stylesheets. Understanding how to nest styles not only enhances readability but also streamlines the 
organization of our codebase. The concept of mixins was particularly intriguing, as it allows for the creation 
of reusable chunks of CSS, ultimately promoting modularity and scalability in our projects. Additionally, exploring 
conditional statements and loops within SassScript provided valuable insights into dynamically managing styles 
based on various conditions. Extending mixins offers a convenient way to inherit styles, further optimizing code 
reuse. These newfound skills will significantly elevate my CSS development workflow, enabling me to write 
better, faster, and more advanced stylesheets with Sass.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
One thing that I've realized recently is how much I've underestimated the importance of tools like VVV, Sass, and 
WordPress in speeding up my work. I used to prefer doing everything manually because I thought it allowed me to have 
full control over every little detail. However, I've come to see that this approach is incredibly time-consuming, 
difficult, and prone to mistakes. Since I'm having some difficulties with my time this trimester, I've come to 
appreciate just how much easier it is to have these tools and frameworks at my disposal. In the past, I was reluctant
to use them because I wanted to make sure that all the details are perfect and the code is clean. But now, I'm starting
to see the value in letting automated scripts and frameworks handle the heavy lifting, following standardized 
procedures. That being said, it's a bit difficult to break away the habits immediately since it is something that I've 
built up over the years, but in the future, I'll be more open to these kinds of tools and technologies.
