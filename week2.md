## Content Insights
Throughout the course, I gained a comprehensive understanding of constructing a WordPress website from scratch. The 
course covered a range of aspects, from widgets, menus, pages, posts, blocks, to the media library. Lessons also 
included insights into installing plugins and ensuring the security of WordPress websites. The section that 
particularly caught my attention focused on creating backups, which is an area I was previously unfamiliar with. 
Additionally, the course tackled common issues in WordPress websites, offering valuable tips for effective 
troubleshooting.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Having worked with WordPress websites for a while, there have been instances where I unintentionally crashed the site
while making changes. Due to my lack of knowledge on creating backups, I had to seek external help. Now that I've 
learned how to create backups, I can finally use it as an additional precaution to avoid (or recover from) website 
crashes. From my experience, fixing issues can be more challenging than creating websites, so I'm grateful to have 
learned valuable troubleshooting techniques through this learning process.
