## Content Insights
The first course covers fundamental skills required to create child themes such as setting up a development 
environment, choosing a parent theme, customizing styles and functions, working with template files, and deploying 
theme files to a live WordPress site. I've learned that choosing an appropriate parent theme is crucial to achieve 
desired visual styles while customizing with child themes. Child themes also allow us to include additional features 
and functionalities beyond the parent theme. The second course emphasizes on designing websites for modularity and 
responsiveness. Flexbox is a great CSS layout model for creating responsive layouts while the browser can be a 
dynamic and flexible canvas. Our code and design can be turned into functional WordPress theme. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing Assignment 1, where I had to create identical websites using different content management systems, 
I've gained a better understanding of the balance between convenience and freedom offered by various tools. WordPress, 
with its intuitive interface and extensive feature set, proves convenient to use. However, it reveals a certain 
restrictiveness in terms of customization and the addition of custom codes. On the flip side, Joomla, while not as 
intuitive, provides more freedom for customization. This contrast became glaringly evident when attempting to 
replicate the same design across different CMSs, proving unexpectedly challenging. I opted for a more versatile hosting 
platform, which offered greater freedom, however demands more effort and can pose more issues. Interestingly, my 
classmates who chose dedicated web hosting services experienced faster setup times and encountered fewer issues. This 
experience highlights the importance of choosing the right tool to achieve optimal results. Balancing convenience 
and freedom in alignment with project requirements is key in navigating the complexities of various projects.
