# Week 6

## Learning Activities & Resources
- Watched a video on LinkedIn Learning about Agile at Work


## Estimated Hours
- 1 hour

## Content Insights
- The video covers the basics of Agile projects and how it differs from traditional project management. Agile
- development is more flexible and aimed at delivering highest-value product, wherein, traditional projects
- are carried out under pre-defined scope. One of the most interesting things about Agile projects is having talkers 
- and sitters in team communications to ensure its effectiveness. This certainly seems to be quite the challenging
- task, especially when most people are used to traditional projects where everyone is expected to contribute in
- team communication. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- In Agile development, it is extremely important to have different people in different roles, and that those 
- people fulfill their roles well. Looking back at my experience in Design Thinking, the roles and 
- responsibilities of the team members were mixed up since we didn't have any deep understanding about Agile
- projects. Because of this, we instinctively and unknowingly reverted to back traditional project management 
- methods. For instance, if someone were to be able to facilitate the scrum master role in that project,
- things would have gone much smoother in our workflow. On an unrelated note, after discussing the group agreement
- and reflecting on my past-experiences, I have come to realize that it is often more important to attempt to
- resolve the issue rather than to hold people accountable when there is a problem. This is not to say that 
- attempting to hold people accountable is not appropriate, however, getting to resolution is generally what 
- brings us to a positive outcome in such situations.
