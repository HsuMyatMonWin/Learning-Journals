The course explains the process of migrating a WordPress site from one location to another using 
the free plugin WP Migrate DB. It includes three main steps: setting up the new site, migrating files 
via FTP, and migrating the database by duplicating and resetting it with WP Migrate DB. The course also
addresses common issues in WordPress migration and provides troubleshooting techniques. This course aims
to demonstrate include installing WP Migrate DB on both sites, exporting and importing the database, 
understanding push and pull mechanisms, and using the premium features for more efficient migration.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Learning how to migrate WordPress website lets me build it on a local environment first and then transfer
it to a web hosting platform. This makes it easy to collaborate with others, especially when many people
are working on the same project. I'm excited to try these methods in Assignment 2 to get hands-on experience.
I think it will enhance my employability and find new opportunities in my career. This week, I took it easy on the 
LinkedIn learning courses while working on my assignments to keep me from being overwhelmed. I've noticed that finding 
a balance between different tasks is really helpful for my learning and getting things done efficiently.
