# Week 10

## Learning Activities & Resources
- Watched a video on LinkedIn Learning about WordPress Security

## Estimated Hours
- 2 hours and 30 minutes

## Content Insights
Through this course, I've gained valuable insights into securing WordPress websites against potential 
threats. On a fundamental level, regular backups, robust passwords, and user role management will help secure our
WordPress websites against common security threats. On a deeper level, the course explores advanced techniques 
such as authentication keys, file permissions, and firewall implementation to enhance the site security even further.
I also learned strategies to combat spam, detect hacks, and prevent bot intrusions, alongside essential practices
for auditing and reporting vulnerabilities. With this knowledge, I will be able to safeguard WordPress sites and 
ensure the protection of valuable data to user trust.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
For my final learning journal, I would like to discuss the insights gained from this subject . Following Assignment 2, 
I have gained a comprehensive understanding of the development and deployment processes, as well as technical 
intricacies and limitations of various tools. While learning activities provided foundational knowledge, I didn't fully
understand the workflow until I put everything to practice. For instance, I initially assumed that GitHub could 
synchronize everything in the local environment, only to realize later that WordPress incorporates both the database 
and site files, thus only the files can be synchronized. This highlights how theoretical learning alone cannot achieve
a complete learning experience and practical experience is required.
Moreover, I have gained insights into effective communication and emotional management. Both excessive and insufficient
communication can lead to ineffective communication, and inability to management one's emotions during interactions 
with colleagues will result in unnecessary conflicts. Emotions, if unchecked, may distort a person's ability to see
things with clarity, due to inherent human tendencies towards defensiveness and close-mindedness in 
confrontational situations.
Lastly, I wish to highlight the benefits of self-directed learning, which initially posed challenges but ultimately 
proved rewarding. Despite initial frustrations stemming from the need to learn various things by myself,
I have gained a wealth of technical knowledge and refined learning strategies though trial and error. This self-driven
approach has enhanced my confidence, as achievements were the result of my personal effort. While the experience
through this subject may not have been wholly enjoyable, the outcomes prove to be very valuable and fulfilling.
